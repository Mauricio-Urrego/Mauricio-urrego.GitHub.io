# mauricio-urrego.github.io

My plan for this site is to act as a catch-all portfolio for everything I have ever worked on (that is shareable, of course there are proprietary works that I may not share because of a non-disclosure agreement, among other reasons).

As we know, anything in the coding world, especially in web development, can be improved over time as new skills are learned or as we add more functionality over time. I want this site to consistently evolve over my career. Some ideas I have for the future of the site are below. If you'd like to try your hand at doing anything in the list, please let me know! Feel free to clone this repo and make your changes.

Ideas:
1. Make circle of planets into an oval shape with a vanishing point to give the illusion of depth.
2. Planets move slower when farther behind me and faster when in front of me.
3. Click a planet's link and the screen earthquake shakes before a rocket takes over the screen. The rocket zooms by, the screen flashes to white, and then the link loads.
4. On mouse hover the hovered on planet glows from behind.
5. Click on me and I transform into a rocket and blast off.
6. Photoshop of me holding a sign, saying something different every refresh.
7. Replace images of planets with rotating 3D videos.
8. Replace image of me with 360 degree rotating video (I need a special camera for this if anyone has one).
9. Make the site entirely Virtual Reality compatible.
10. Make the site Augmented Reality compatible.
11. Integrate a space invader-like game into the site as a sort of easter egg.
